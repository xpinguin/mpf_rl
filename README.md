Memory-Prediction Framework with Reinforcement Learning extension
=================================================================

Current MPF hierarchy implementation is inspired and actually based on this paper:

[David Rawlinson, Gideon Kowadlo - "Generating Adaptive Behaviour within a Memory-Prediction Framework", 2012](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029264)

Special thanks to [Mike McConnel](djrahl84@gmail.com) for his project [Snakey Party](https://github.com/djrahl/snakey_party) which I've vivisected a bit and now using as one of benchmarks for the MPF :)
