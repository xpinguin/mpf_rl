Memory-Prediction Framework with Reinforcement Learning extension
=================================================================

Current MPF hierarchy implementation is inspired and actually based on this paper:

[David Rawlinson, Gideon Kowadlo - "Generating Adaptive Behaviour within a Memory-Prediction Framework", 2012](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029264)

---------------------------------------------------

The existence of this project is mostly explained by two main purposes:

1. To support my Bachelor's Thesis "Experimental research of Hierarchical Temporal Memory application to the task of controlling an intelligent agent"
(Original title: "Экспериментальное исследование применения Иерархической Временной Памяти в задаче управления интеллектуальным агентом")

2. As an open source project/initiative intended to provide (at certain point of its development process) a flexible general-purpose AI for controlling mobile agents

REMARK: For instance, this code is used as a part of Amnesia Team's project participating in "Flying Robots Contest 2013", which is conducted in Russia by one commercial organization.

Special thanks to [Mike McConnel](djrahl84@gmail.com) for his project [Snakey Party](https://github.com/djrahl/snakey_party) which I've vivisected a bit and now using as one of benchmarks for the MPF :)
